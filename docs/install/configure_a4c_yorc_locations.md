# Configure locations

To be able to deploy applications from Alien4Cloud, you will need to configure locations,
infrastructures where Yorc will allocate resources and deploy the Applications.

Yorc supports the following locations :

* Google Compute Engine,
* AWS EC2,
* OpenStack
* Kubernetes
* Slurm,
* Hosts Pool, pool of any kind of host to which you can connect through ssh

The following sections will describe in details how to configure a Google Compute
Engine location from Alien4Cloud UI, and a Hosts Pool.
For the other locations, see Yorc Alien4Cloud plugin documentation section [Configure a Yorc Orchestrator and a Location](https://yorc-a4c-plugin.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.1/location.html).
